# Education_and_Taxes
Analyzing IRS data to determine if areas with greater educational (early learning through college) opportunities correlate with electronic filings.

## Datasets used: 
Public Schools (early learning - grade 12): https://www.kaggle.com/carlosaguayo/usa-public-schools

IRS: https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi

College/University: https://www.registrar.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/codebook/bystate.pdf

## Transformation: 
Cleaned data sets to focus strictly on Indiana and for the year 2018 with the exception of public school set, which is defined as being 2014-2015 school year. Census API was used to find population data to compare with tax filings reported by the IRS.

## Drawbacks:
Data for taxes and census is for 2018. The public school data is for 2014 only; however, it is assumed there has been no school closings or openings within that time period.
